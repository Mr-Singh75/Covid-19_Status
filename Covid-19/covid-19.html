        <h1>What Is Covid-19 ?</h1>
        <p>
            Coronavirus disease (<span class="covid">COVID-19</span>) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus. Most people infected with the <span class="covid">COVID-19</span> virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory
            illness and recover without requiring special treatment. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness. The
            best way to prevent and slow down transmission is be well informed about the <span class="covid">COVID-19</span> virus, the disease it causes and how it spreads. Protect yourself and others from infection by washing your hands or using an
            alcohol based rub frequently and not touching your face. The <span class="covid">COVID-19</span> virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes, so itâ€™s important that
            you also practice respiratory etiquette (for example, by coughing into a flexed elbow).
